## Introduction
GreenCode is a Smart Plant Monitoring and Automatic Irrigation system. GreenCode allows users to monitor and control their plants via a mobile app, using real-time sensor data for soil moisture, temperature, light intensity, and more.

## Key Features:
 1. Real-time Sensor Data and Health Monitoring: View live sensor readings and assess your plantâ€™s health status in real time. ðŸŒ±

 2. Automatic and Manual Irrigation: Irrigation is triggered either automatically based on soil moisture levels or manually controlled via the app or hardware interface. ðŸ’§

 3. Smart Notifications: Receive alerts through a buzzer, LED, and in-app notifications for issues like low water levels or insufficient light. ðŸ””

 4. Data Analytics and Visualizations: Track plant health over time with insightful charts and trends. ðŸ“Š

## Main Frameworks and Data Flow:

 1. ESP32 Sensor Publishing: The ESP32 sends sensor readings in JSON format to a HiveMQ broker using the MQTT protocol. ðŸ“¡

 2. Node-RED Integration: Node-RED subscribes to the MQTT topic to collect sensor data, automating data logging into Google Sheets for historical tracking and visualization through Grafana dashboards. ðŸ”—

 3. Flutter App Functionality: The app subscribes to HiveMQ for real-time sensor data display, offering live insights into the plant's health. ðŸ“±

 4. Historical Data Visualization: The app integrates with the Google Sheets API (via the gsheets package) to retrieve historical data for visualizations on the Stats screen using the syncfusion_flutter_charts package. ðŸ“Š

 5. Firebase Authentication: The app supports user authentication for SignIn, SignUp, and password recovery using Firebase. ðŸ”’

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Responsiveness**: The system can react quickly to events as they occur. It doesn't rely on constant polling, making it efficient for real-time applications like your plant monitoring system.

**Modularity**: New sensors, actuators, or functionalities can be added with minimal impact on existing code. You simply define new events and corresponding actions within the eventHandlerTask.

**Flexibility**: The order and timing of events are not predetermined. The system adapts dynamically to changing conditions and user inputs.
